A new thread for each client connection is created. Thread destroyed when connection to client is closed.

Threading locks used for preventing simultaneous access to the todo list file. Tested with time.sleep.

Simultaneous access to the file in a best case would result to just some changes not going trough. Worst
case I'm not sure if the program would crash with the file being open in multiple threads or what.

With locks each thread needs to wait for a turn to access the file, not very efficient, but in this case works.
